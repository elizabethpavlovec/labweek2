### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

```{r plastic-waste-continent}
plastic_waste_filter <- plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 3.5)

plastic_waste %>%
  ggplot (aes(x=plastic_waste_per_cap, color = continent, fill = continent))+
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)+
    coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,0.8))+
    facet_wrap(continent ~ .)
```
_From looking at the graph, North America has the most plastic waste per cap, ranking first. The continent with the least plastic waste per cap would be Africa._

### Exercise 2

```{r plastic-waste-density}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
```

### Exercise 3
_The color and fill separates the data by color coding the data, while alpha changes the transparency of the data to help visualize the difference between the data._

### Exercise 4

```{r plastic-waste-violin}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap,
                     color = continent,
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_violin()
```

### Exercise 5

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
       mapping = aes(x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap,
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_point()
```
_The plastic waste and mismanaged plastic waste has a positive correlation, which suggests that as plastic waste increases - mismanaged platic waste will also increase._

### Exercise 6

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged-continent}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
       mapping = aes(x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap,
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap,
                     color = continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Exercise 7

*The two pairs of variable does not appear to be strong linearly associated.*

```{r plastic-waste-population-total}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
                     y = total_pop,
                     color = continent)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r plastic-waste-population-coastal}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
      mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
                     y = coastal_pop,
                    color = continent)) + 
  geom_point()
```

### Exercise 8

*The relationship between plastic waste per cap and coastal pop prop become weaker and eventually breaks when coastal pop prop is greater than 1.*

```{r recreate-viz}
plastic_waste_edit <- plastic_waste %>% 
  mutate(coastal_pop_prop = coastal_pop / total_pop) %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 3)
  
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_edit, 
       mapping = aes(x = coastal_pop_prop, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(color = "black") +
    scale_color_viridis_d()
```
